# minesweeper
A Minesweeper game that runs on JGrasp in Java

To play the game, open the folder "Minesweeper", then open the Java file "MineSweeperGUI.java". Run the Java file and enjoy.

If you are interested in making a custom difficulty Minesweeper game, create a text file (.txt) with the following format and save the file in the "Custom Games" folder:

/// Beginning of the text File ///
6
7
1232100
1XXX100
1243200
001X210
1112X10
X101110
/// End of the text file ///

Explaination:
The first line of the txt file represents the number of rows in the gameboard, the second line represents the columns of the gameboard.
The rest of the code is the gameboard, where the positive integers represents the number of mines around it, and 'X' represents a mine tile.


A sample.txt file is alraedy prepared in the "Custom Games" folder.
